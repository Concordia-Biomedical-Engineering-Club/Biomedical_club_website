Utilizing a dataset of labeled skin images provided by Livewell, we will train a machine learning model to analyze images and deliver precise diagnostic outputs. The project also includes creating a user-friendly web application using React/Next.js, allowing dermatologists to upload images and receive instant feedback with visual indicators highlighting affected areas. This innovative tool aims to streamline the diagnostic process and enhance the accuracy of skin condition assessments.",
