## Our Commitment

As members of the **Concordia Biomedical Engineering Club (BEC)**, we are dedicated to creating a welcoming, respectful, and collaborative environment for everyone. We believe that diversity, inclusivity, and respect make our community stronger.

Our goal is to ensure that all students and participants feel valued, supported, and empowered to contribute to the club and its activities.

## Our Principles

To uphold these values, we agree to follow these principles:

1. **Be Respectful.**
   Treat everyone with kindness and respect. We may not always agree, but disagreement is never an excuse for disrespectful behavior, personal attacks, or exclusion. Different perspectives and experiences are what make our club stronger.

2. **Collaborate Constructively.**
   Whether weâ€™re working on projects, planning events, or sharing ideas, we commit to engaging in open, thoughtful, and constructive discussions. Feedback should focus on ideas, not individuals.

3. **Be Supportive.**
   We are a community that learns and grows together. Share knowledge, help each other, and celebrate each otherâ€™s achievements. We succeed as a team.
